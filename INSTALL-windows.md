### Installation on Windows
The Windows installation process differs more widely from installation on Linux or MacOSX and has different issues you may run into.

### Process
   * Increase the maximum size of your pagefile to 64G or more (http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-2864547/manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows.html ) - The Windows memmap interface is sensitive to the maximum setting and leaving it at the default can cause errors when processing larger datasets
   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.x, not 2.x) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>. Allow the installer to modify your PATH variable
   * Use Conda to install git (With "conda install git") - use of another commandline git is acceptable, but may lead to issues depending on default settings
   * Install Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017>. Check the "Build Tools" box, and in the detailed view on the right check the "C/C++ CLI Tools" component too. The specifics of this occasionally change as Microsoft changes its products and website; you may need to go off-script.

Use the following menu item to launch a anaconda-enabled command prompt: start>programs>anaconda3>anaconda prompt
From that prompt. issue the following commands (if you wish to use the dev branch, you may switch branches after the clone):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn
   cd CaImAn
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n caiman
   conda install -n caiman vs2017_win-64
   ```

At this point you will want to remove a startup script that visual studio made for your conda environment that can cause conda to crash while entering the caiman environment. Use the Windows find-file utility (under the Start Menu) to look for vs2015_compiler_vars.bat and/or vs2015_compiler_vars.bat under your home directory. At least one copy should show up. Delete the version that has conda\envs\caiman as part of its location. You may also want to do a search for keras_activate.bat under your home directory, find the one in conda\envs\caiman, and edit it so KERAS_BACKEND is set to tensorflow rather than theano. You may then continue the installation.

   ```bash
   activate caiman
   pip install . (OR pip install -e . if you want to develop code)
   copy caimanmanager.py ..
   conda install numba
   cd ..
   ```

### Setting up a data directory with caimanmanager

Now that you have stepped out of the caiman source directory, you are ready to make a data directory with code samples and datasets. You will not use the source tree directory any more. 

  ```
  caimanmanager.py install
  ```
  or 
  ```
  python caimanmanager.py install --inplace
  ```
  if you used "pip install -e ." 

This will place that directory under your home directory in a directory called caiman_data. If you have, some of the demos or datafiles may have changed since your last install, to follow API changes. You can check to see if they have by doing `caimanmanager.py check`. If they have not, you may keep using them. If they have, we recommend moving your old caiman data directory out of the way (or just remove them if you have no precious data) and doing a new data install as per above.

If you prefer to manage this information somewhere else, the `CAIMAN_DATA` environment variable can be set to customise it. The caimanmanager tool and other libraries will respect that.

### Setting up environment variables 

To make the package work *efficiently* and eliminate "crosstalk" between different processes, run these commands before launching Python:

   ```bash
   set MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
   set OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
   set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
   ```   

The commands should be run every time you enter the caiman conda environment. We recommend you save these values inside your environment so you do not have to repeat this process every time. You can do this by following the instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#saving-environment-variables).
